## Introduction

Ascend is a **fully verifiable event perpetuals decentralized exchange** enabling leveraged trading on **outcome probabilities**. Ascend supports **Cardano, EVM, and Solana environments**, while enforcing all trading, risk, account, and settlement logic within Midnight, a **Cardano partnerchain** with **multi-resource consensus and native privacy.**

Ascend inspires from Midnight's **Minotaur philosophy** for **multichain DeFi execution**, privacy focused, policy-driven model to:

- Order execution
- Margin and leverage enforcement
- Liquidation logic
- Event settlement

This allows execution rights, capital, risk, and permissions to be treated as **distinct yet composable resources**, all enforced under zero-knowledge guarantees.

Ascend adopts a **ZK-enforced execution architecture**, where all user actions are finalized on Midnight.

The architecture is designed to:

- Maximize throughput
- Preserve user privacy
- Provide cryptographic guarantees of correctness
- Maintain a single canonical execution state

## Ascend Engines

Instead of separating execution into off-chain and on-chain domains, Ascend structures protocol logic into **deterministic execution engines**, each enforced through Midnight ZK verification.

### Core Engines

| Ascend Engine | Responsibility |
|---------------|----------------|
| Matching Engine | Executes probability-priced event perpetual orders |
| Risk Engine | Evaluates margin, leverage, and liquidation conditions |
| Account Engine | Manages funding and trading account state |
| Fund Control Engine | Handles internal and external fund movements |
| Event Engine | Governs event lifecycle and resolution |

All engine outputs are subject to **ZK-verified constraints** and committed via Midnight.

## Execution & Verification

### Trade Execution

- Orders are signed using **native ecosystem credentials** (Cardano, EVM or Solana)
- Orders are interpreted by the Ascend Matching Engine
- Execution results are validated by the Risk Engine
- Final state transitions are proven and committed on Midnight

### Risk & Liquidation Enforcement

- Margin requirements are evaluated per trading account
- Liquidation conditions are checked deterministically
- Liquidation actions are only applied if ZK-verified as fair

---

## Accounts & Users

### Funding Account

A **Funding Account** represents the primary on-chain ownership entity within Ascend.

Its responsibilities include:

- Accepting and managing deposits
- Processing withdrawals
- Transferring funds to other funding accounts
- Allocating capital to associated trading accounts

Each funding account tracks:

- Available and locked collateral
- Associated trading accounts
- Assigned permissions and roles
- Configured multi-signature approval thresholds

---

### Trading Account

- Trading accounts are **subordinate accounts** associated with a funding account
- Dedicated exclusively to trading operations
- Enforce isolated margin per account
- Maintain independent liquidation conditions

A single funding account can be linked to **multiple trading accounts**, consistent with the account hierarchy used in comparable ZK-enabled exchange architectures.

---

## Account State Model

### On-Chain Accounting

All account-related state is maintained as **zero-knowledge–verified state on Midnight**.

**Funding Account state** includes:

- Aggregate collateral balance
- References to linked trading accounts
- Role and permission assignments
- Multi-signature policy configuration

**Trading Account state** includes:

- Active positions
- Margin utilization
- Accrued funding adjustments
- Liquidation eligibility status

---

## Identity & Credentials

Ascend implements a **fully cryptographic identity framework** working with existing KYC, KYB and identity providers.

### Identity Principles

- A single user may control multiple protocol accounts
- Account ownership is tied to one or more cryptographic keys
- Authorization is enforced through signed actions
- No separate Web2 identity layer is required for protocol-level execution

This model removes the need for a Web2/Web3 credential split while preserving equivalent permissioning and access guarantees found in other institutional-grade trading systems.
