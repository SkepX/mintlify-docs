## Introduction

Ascend is a **fully verifiable event perpetuals decentralized exchange** enabling leveraged trading on **outcome probabilities**. Ascend supports **Cardano, EVM, and Solana environments**, while enforcing all trading, risk, account, and settlement logic within Midnight, a **Cardano partnerchain** with **multi-resource consensus and native privacy.** Ascend inspires from Midnight's **Minotaur philosophy** for **multichain DeFi execution**, privacy focused, policy-driven model to:

- Order execution
- Margin and leverage enforcement
- Liquidation logic
- Event settlement

This allows execution rights, capital, risk, and permissions to be treated as **distinct yet composable resources**, all enforced under zero-knowledge guarantees.

Ascend adopts a **ZK-enforced execution architecture**, where all user actions are finalized on Midnight.

The architecture is designed to:

- Maximize throughput
- Preserve user privacy
- Provide cryptographic guarantees of correctness
- Maintain a single canonical execution state

## Ascend Engines

Instead of separating execution into off-chain and on-chain domains, Ascend structures protocol logic into **deterministic execution engines**, each enforced through Midnight ZK verification.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Matching Engine" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Executes probability-priced event perpetual orders with deterministic matching.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Risk Engine" icon="chart-line">
    Evaluates margin, leverage, and liquidation conditions in real-time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Account Engine" icon="user">
    Manages funding and trading account state transitions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fund Control Engine" icon="vault">
    Handles internal and external fund movements securely.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Event Engine" icon="calendar-check">
    Governs event lifecycle, resolution, and settlement.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
All engine outputs are subject to **ZK-verified constraints** and committed via Midnight.

## Execution & Verification

### Trade Execution Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign">
    Orders are signed using **native ecosystem credentials** (Cardano, EVM, or Solana)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Match">
    Orders are interpreted by the Ascend Matching Engine
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate">
    Execution results are validated by the Risk Engine
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit">
    Final state transitions are proven and committed on Midnight
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Risk & Liquidation Enforcement

- Margin requirements evaluated per trading account
- Liquidation conditions checked deterministically
- Liquidation actions only applied if **ZK-verified as fair**

## Account Architecture

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Funding Account" icon="wallet">
    The **primary on-chain ownership entity** within Ascend.

    - Accept and manage deposits
    - Process withdrawals
    - Transfer funds between accounts
    - Allocate capital to trading accounts

    Tracks collateral, linked accounts, permissions, and multi-sig thresholds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trading Account" icon="chart-candlestick">
    **Subordinate accounts** dedicated to trading operations.

    - Isolated margin per account
    - Independent liquidation conditions
    - Position and funding tracking

    Multiple trading accounts can link to a single funding account.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Account State Model

All account-related state is maintained as **zero-knowledge–verified state on Midnight**.

| Account Type | State Includes |
|--------------|----------------|
| Funding Account | Collateral balance, linked trading accounts, roles & permissions, multi-sig config |
| Trading Account | Active positions, margin utilization, funding adjustments, liquidation status |

## Identity & Credentials

Ascend implements a **fully cryptographic identity framework** working with existing KYC, KYB, and identity providers.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multi-Account Control" icon="users">
    A single user may control multiple protocol accounts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Key-Based Ownership" icon="key">
    Account ownership tied to cryptographic keys
  </Card>
  <Card title="Signed Authorization" icon="signature">
    All actions enforced through signed transactions
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Web2 Layer" icon="ban">
    No separate Web2 identity required for execution
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
This model removes the need for a Web2/Web3 credential split while preserving institutional-grade permissioning and access guarantees.
