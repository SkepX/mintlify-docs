title: 'PnL & Leverage Basics'
description: 'How profits and losses actually scale with moves'
---

On Ascend, you profit or lose based on how the probability price moves relative to your entry price. This is scaled by your position size and leverage.

<Note>
PnL updates continuously as prices change. You do not have to wait for event resolution to see gains or losses.
</Note>

## The PnL Formula

Unrealized PnL is calculated using four inputs:

| Input | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| Entry Price | The probability price when you opened the position |
| Mark Price | The current probability price used for valuation |
| Position Size | How large your position is |
| Direction | +1 for LONG, -1 for SHORT |

The formula:

```
Unrealized PnL = Direction × Position Size × (Mark Price − Entry Price)
```

This applies symmetrically to LONG and SHORT positions.

## PnL Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="LONG position, probability rises" icon="arrow-up">
    You open LONG at 50% with position size 1,000 USDC notional.

    Probability rises to 58%.

    ```
    PnL = +1 × 1,000 × (0.58 − 0.50)
        = +1 × 1,000 × 0.08
        = +80 USDC
    ```

    You are up 80 USDC.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="LONG position, probability falls" icon="arrow-down">
    You open LONG at 50% with position size 1,000 USDC notional.

    Probability falls to 44%.

    ```
    PnL = +1 × 1,000 × (0.44 − 0.50)
        = +1 × 1,000 × (−0.06)
        = −60 USDC
    ```

    You are down 60 USDC.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SHORT position, probability falls" icon="arrow-down">
    You open SHORT at 65% with position size 1,000 USDC notional.

    Probability falls to 58%.

    ```
    PnL = −1 × 1,000 × (0.58 − 0.65)
        = −1 × 1,000 × (−0.07)
        = +70 USDC
    ```

    You are up 70 USDC.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SHORT position, probability rises" icon="arrow-up">
    You open SHORT at 65% with position size 1,000 USDC notional.

    Probability rises to 72%.

    ```
    PnL = −1 × 1,000 × (0.72 − 0.65)
        = −1 × 1,000 × 0.07
        = −70 USDC
    ```

    You are down 70 USDC.
  </Accordion>

## How Leverage Works

Leverage allows you to control a larger position with less capital.

The relationship between margin and position size:

```
Initial Margin = Position Notional / Leverage
```

Or flipped:

```
Position Notional = Initial Margin × Leverage
```

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1x Leverage" icon="1">
    100 USDC margin controls 100 USDC notional. A 10% probability move means 10 USDC PnL.
  </Card>

  <Card title="10x Leverage" icon="10">
    100 USDC margin controls 1,000 USDC notional. A 10% probability move means 100 USDC PnL.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Higher leverage increases sensitivity to probability movement. The same price change creates a larger PnL impact.

## Leverage Example

You have 100 USDC and want to go LONG at 50%.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="5x Leverage">
    **Position notional:** 100 × 5 = 500 USDC

    Probability rises from 50% to 55% (5 point move).

    ```
    PnL = 500 × 0.05 = +25 USDC
    ```

    Return on margin: 25%
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="10x Leverage">
    **Position notional:** 100 × 10 = 1,000 USDC

    Probability rises from 50% to 55% (5 point move).

    ```
    PnL = 1,000 × 0.05 = +50 USDC
    ```

    Return on margin: 50%
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="20x Leverage">
    **Position notional:** 100 × 20 = 2,000 USDC

    Probability rises from 50% to 55% (5 point move).

    ```
    PnL = 2,000 × 0.05 = +100 USDC
    ```

    Return on margin: 100%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The same 5 point move produces 25, 50, or 100 USDC depending on leverage. This works in both directions. Losses scale the same way.

---

## Leverage Cuts Both Ways

Higher leverage amplifies losses just as it amplifies gains.

| Leverage | 5 Point Gain | 5 Point Loss |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| 5x | +25 USDC | -25 USDC |
| 10x | +50 USDC | -50 USDC |
| 20x | +100 USDC | -100 USDC |

With 20x leverage, a 5 point move against you wipes your entire 100 USDC margin.

Leverage operates within explicit market-defined limits to ensure consistent risk behavior.

---

## Mark-to-Market

Positions are continuously marked to the mark price.

This means:

<Check>PnL updates in real time as probabilities move</Check>
<Check>Your equity (margin + unrealized PnL) changes constantly</Check>
<Check>Risk checks run against current mark price, not entry price</Check>

You always know where you stand. No waiting for settlement to see your position value.

## Position Lifecycle

A position on Ascend follows a clear lifecycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open">
    You open a LONG or SHORT position with defined margin and leverage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update">
    As probability prices change, PnL and risk metrics update in real time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage">
    You may increase, reduce, or partially close the position at any time within market rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close">
    The position is closed voluntarily by you or through system-defined processes like liquidation or settlement.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each stage follows deterministic mechanics governed by market parameters.
