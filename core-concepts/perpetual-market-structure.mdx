description: 'Why Ascend markets never expire and how continuous trading works'
---

Traditional prediction markets work like bets. You buy a position, wait for the event, and settle. The contract expires. The market closes.

Ascend works differently.

Markets on Ascend are **perpetual**. They do not expire on a fixed date. Positions persist until you close them or the market reaches its defined settlement condition. You can enter, adjust, or exit at any time.

This is the same structure used by the largest crypto derivatives exchanges, applied to prediction markets.

## Continuous, Not Discrete

Prediction markets are traditionally structured around discrete contracts with fixed expiry windows.

Ascend removes this constraint.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional Prediction Markets" icon="hourglass-end">
    Fixed expiry date. Contract ends at resolution. Must re-enter for new exposure. Liquidity fragments across time windows.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Ascend Perpetuals" icon="infinity">
    No fixed expiry. Positions persist continuously. Adjust exposure anytime. Liquidity concentrates in one venue.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Probability prices update continuously based on trading activity and oracle inputs. The market is always open.

## Persistent Positions

Once you open a position, it remains active until one of three things happens:

<Steps>
  <Step title="You close it">
    You decide to exit. You take your PnL and move on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Risk conditions trigger closure">
    If margin requirements are no longer met, the system may reduce or close your position to protect market integrity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The market settles">
    The underlying event resolves and all positions settle at the final probability.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Until one of these occurs, your position stays open. You are not forced out by a calendar.

## Orderbook-Driven Liquidity

Ascend uses an orderbook model for price discovery.

Traders place bids and offers around probability prices. Trades execute directly between participants. There is no AMM, no liquidity pool, no protocol-owned inventory.

<Check>Prices reflect genuine supply and demand</Check>
<Check>Depth forms organically around conviction levels</Check>
<Check>Spreads tighten as participation increases</Check>
<Check>No slippage from bonding curves</Check>

The orderbook is the market.

## Price Alignment Mechanisms

Perpetual markets need a way to stay anchored to reality. Without expiry forcing convergence, prices could drift from true probability levels.

Ascend solves this with two mechanisms:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Oracle Anchoring">
    Probability prices are sourced from external prediction markets and oracles. The **Index Price** represents the best available estimate of the true probability at any moment.

    Ascend does not invent prices. It references them.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Funding">
    When the traded price diverges from the Index Price, funding payments transfer between LONG and SHORT positions.

    If traders push the price too high, LONGs pay SHORTs. If traders push the price too low, SHORTs pay LONGs.

    This creates a continuous incentive to keep prices aligned with external signals.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

These mechanisms allow perpetual markets to track probability accurately without requiring forced settlement.

## Why Perpetual Structure Matters

The perpetual model unlocks capabilities that traditional prediction markets cannot offer:

| Capability | Traditional | Perpetual |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Continuous trading | ❌ Ends at expiry | ✅ Always open |
| Leverage | ❌ Limited or none | ✅ Full margin framework |
| Active management | ❌ Bet and wait | ✅ Enter, adjust, exit anytime |
| Liquidity depth | ❌ Fragmented by expiry | ✅ Concentrated |
| Real-time price discovery | ❌ Stale between trades | ✅ Continuous |

Prediction markets become trading venues, not betting slips.

## How Ascend Remains a Perp Despite Resolution

Some prediction markets do resolve. Elections happen. Decisions get announced. Events conclude.

Does resolution break the perpetual model?

No. Here is why:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Perpetual until resolved" icon="clock">
    Markets trade continuously right up until the resolution condition is met. There is no arbitrary expiry date forcing closure before the event.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Not bound to timestamps" icon="calendar-xmark">
    Traditional contracts expire on a specific date regardless of whether the event has occurred. Ascend markets expire only when the actual outcome is known.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No expiry cycles" icon="rotate">
    There are no quarterly expiries, no contract migrations, no liquidity fragmentation. One market, one orderbook, continuous trading.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Resolution is an endpoint, not an expiry. The market remains perpetual in structure even if it eventually settles.

## The Foundation

Perpetual structure is not a feature. It is the foundation that makes everything else possible.

<Check>Leverage requires continuous margin management. Perpetual enables this.</Check>
<Check>Active trading requires persistent positions. Perpetual enables this.</Check>
<Check>Deep liquidity requires concentrated venues. Perpetual enables this.</Check>
<Check>Real-time price discovery requires continuous markets. Perpetual enables this.</Check>

This is why Ascend is built as a perpetual exchange, not a prediction platform.
