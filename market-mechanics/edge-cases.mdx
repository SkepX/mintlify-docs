## Binary Compression Near Extremes

As probability prices approach 0% or 100%:

- Marginal price movement becomes asymmetrical
- Small probability changes can have outsized impact
- Liquidity naturally thins near extremes

Ascend handles this by:

- Applying consistent tick sizing
- Maintaining symmetric LONG / SHORT mechanics
- Preserving deterministic PnL behavior

---

## Probability Drift Without Resolution

Some probability markets may drift for extended periods without ever reaching resolution.

Examples:

- Long-term macro expectations
- Ongoing policy speculation
- Persistent sentiment indicators

Behavior:

- Markets remain continuously tradable
- Funding maintains alignment with external signals
- No forced settlement occurs

This enables prediction markets to function as **ongoing probability instruments**, not one-off bets.

---

## Sudden Truth Revelation

Some events resolve instantaneously and unambiguously.

Examples:

- Official results released
- Market-moving announcements

Behavior:

- Index Price updates immediately
- Mark Price converges deterministically
- Settlement proceeds according to predefined rules

No discretionary delay is introduced.

---

## Contrarian Liquidity Vacuums

At high confidence levels, few traders may be willing to take the opposing side.

Behavior:

- Spreads widen naturally
- Funding incentives increase
- Liquidity reflects true market conviction

Markets remain functional without artificial liquidity injection.

## Oracle Irregularities

### Stale Oracle Data

If one or more oracle sources stop updating:

- Stale inputs are excluded from Index Price calculation
- Remaining valid sources continue to contribute
- Mark Price smoothing limits sudden jumps

If insufficient valid sources remain, the market may enter a **restricted state** until updates resume.

---

### Conflicting Oracle Inputs

If oracle inputs diverge beyond acceptable bounds:

- Outlier prices are ignored according to predefined thresholds
- Weighted aggregation continues using valid inputs
- The Mark Price clamp limits divergence

This prevents a single oracle from dominating price formation.
