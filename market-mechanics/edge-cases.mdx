Prediction markets can experience sudden price swings, oracle issues, and unusual conditions. Ascend is designed to handle these gracefully while protecting traders.

## Extreme Price Movements

### What Counts as Extreme

- Rapid moves (20%+ change in minutes)
- Flash spikes followed by reversals
- Prices near 0% or 100%
- Thin liquidity causing outsized impact

### Mark Price Protection

During extreme moves, Mark Price smoothing provides stability.

**Example: Flash spike**

| Time | Index | Mark | What Happens |
|------|-------|------|--------------|
| 0:00 | 55% | 55% | Normal trading |
| 0:01 | 78% | 66% | Spike begins. Mark lags. |
| 0:02 | 82% | 74% | Mark rises but stays behind. |
| 0:03 | 58% | 66% | Index reverses. Mark smooths. |
| 0:04 | 56% | 61% | Mark converges back. |

The Mark Price never reached 82%. Traders were not liquidated at the spike peak.

### Circuit Breakers

In extreme conditions, the system may automatically:

- Pause trading to prevent cascading liquidations
- Widen spreads reflecting uncertainty
- Reduce max leverage for new positions

These activate based on predefined rules, not manual intervention.

## Trading Near Boundaries

As prices approach 0% or 100%:

| Position | Near 0% | Near 100% |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| LONG | High upside if rises, total loss if settles at 0% | Limited upside, expected settlement |
| SHORT | Limited downside | High risk if outcome confirms |

Small probability changes near boundaries create outsized PnL.

## Drift vs Instant Resolution

### Slow Drift

Drift is when prices creep in one direction as news trickles in.

**Example:** A market on "Will Company X be acquired?" moves from 25% to 61% over three months. No single event caused a big jump.

**Watch for:**
- Funding adds up over time
- Margin shrinks quietly against slow moves

### Instant Resolution

Resolution is when the outcome becomes known and price jumps to 0% or 100% in seconds.

| Entry | Direction | Settles at 100% | Settles at 0% |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 40% | LONG | +60% | -40% |
| 40% | SHORT | -60% | +40% |
| 70% | LONG | +30% | -70% |
| 70% | SHORT | -30% | +70% |

You do not have to hold through resolution. You can take profit or reduce size anytime before.

## Oracle Irregularities

| Type | What Happens | How It's Handled |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| Stale data | Oracle stops updating | Excluded after threshold |
| Price spike | Extreme value reported | Outlier detection filters it |
| Source disagreement | Conflicting prices | Weighted averaging smooths |
| Complete outage | No data received | Fallback or pause |

### Layered Protection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Oracle validation">
    Bad data is flagged and excluded. Staleness checks, outlier detection, and confidence metadata filter unreliable inputs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-source aggregation">
    Index Price averages across sources. No single source dominates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark Price smoothing">
    EMA smoothing dampens impact of bad data on Mark Price.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clamping">
    Mark Price cannot diverge too far from Index too fast.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Market Restrictions

If data quality is compromised:

- **Single source outage**: Remaining sources continue
- **Multiple sources fail**: Market enters restricted state
- **Total outage**: Trading paused until data returns

---

## Key Takeaways

- Mark Price smoothing protects against flash spikes
- Liquidations use Mark Price, not raw Index
- Circuit breakers activate automatically
- Multiple validation layers protect against bad oracle data
- You can exit anytime before resolution
- All handling is deterministic and transparent
