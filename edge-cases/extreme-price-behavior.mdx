title: 'Extreme Price Behavior'
description: 'How the system handles extreme price movements'
---

Prediction markets can experience sudden, dramatic price swings. Breaking news or large trades can push probabilities from 30% to 80% in minutes. Ascend is designed to handle these conditions while protecting traders.

---

## What Counts as Extreme

- Rapid directional moves (20%+ change in minutes)
- Flash spikes followed by immediate reversals
- Price approaching boundaries (near 0% or 100%)
- Thin liquidity causing outsized impact from single trades

---

## Mark Price Protection

During extreme moves, the Mark Price system provides stability through EMA smoothing.

**Example: Flash spike**

| Time | Index | Mark | What Happens |
|------|-------|------|--------------|
| 0:00 | 55% | 55% | Normal trading |
| 0:01 | 78% | 66% | Spike begins. Mark lags. |
| 0:02 | 82% | 74% | Mark rises but stays behind. |
| 0:03 | 58% | 66% | Index reverses. Mark smooths. |
| 0:04 | 56% | 61% | Mark converges back. |

The Mark Price never reached 82%. Traders were not liquidated at the spike peak.

**If Mark lags too far during a sustained move**, clamping pulls it within range of the Index (e.g. ±5%). This ensures Mark tracks real moves while filtering noise.

---

## Liquidation During Volatility

Liquidations use Mark Price, not Index Price.

**Example:** Your LONG has liquidation at 42%. Index spikes to 38% for 30 seconds, then recovers to 52%. Mark only dropped to 45%. You were NOT liquidated.

Without Mark Price smoothing, you would have been liquidated and missed the recovery.

---

## Circuit Breakers

In extreme conditions, Ascend may automatically:

- **Pause trading** temporarily to prevent cascading liquidations
- **Widen spreads** reflecting increased uncertainty
- **Reduce max leverage** for new positions during sustained volatility

These activate based on predefined rules, not manual intervention.

---

## Trading Near Boundaries

As prices approach 0% or 100%:

| Position | Near 0% | Near 100% |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| LONG | High upside if rises, total loss if settles at 0% | Limited upside, expected settlement |
| SHORT | Limited downside | High risk if outcome confirms |

Small probability changes near boundaries create outsized PnL.

## Key Takeaways

- Mark Price smoothing protects against flash spikes
- Liquidations use Mark Price, not raw Index
- Circuit breakers activate automatically in extreme conditions
- Maintain margin buffer for unexpected volatility
