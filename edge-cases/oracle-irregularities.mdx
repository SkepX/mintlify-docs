title: 'Oracle Irregularities'
description: 'How oracle failures and irregularities are handled'
---

Ascend relies on external oracles to source belief prices. Like any external dependency, oracles can experience irregularities. The system is designed to handle these gracefully.

---

## Types of Irregularities

| Type | What Happens | How It's Handled |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| Stale data | Oracle stops updating | Flagged and excluded after threshold |
| Price spike | Extreme value reported | Outlier detection filters it |
| Source disagreement | Oracles report conflicting prices | Weighted averaging smooths differences |
| Complete outage | No data received | Fallback to remaining sources or pause |

---

## Layered Protection

Oracle irregularities must pass through multiple defenses:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Oracle validation">
    Bad data is flagged and excluded before entering the system. Staleness checks, outlier detection, and confidence metadata filter unreliable inputs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-source aggregation">
    Index Price averages across multiple sources. No single source can dominate. If one fails, others continue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark Price smoothing">
    Even if bad data reaches the Index, the EMA smoothing dampens its impact on Mark Price.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clamping">
    Mark Price cannot diverge too far from Index too fast, limiting damage from any single irregularity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example: Oracle Spike

| Time | Index | Mark | Explanation |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0:00 | 55% | 55% | Normal state |
| 0:01 | 88% | 71% | Spike hits Index. Mark smooths. |
| 0:02 | 56% | 63% | Index corrects. Mark follows. |
| 0:03 | 55% | 59% | Convergence continues. |

The Mark Price never reached 88%. Positions were protected.

## Market Restrictions

If data quality is compromised:

- **Single source outage**: Remaining sources continue. Weights renormalize.
- **Multiple sources fail**: Market may enter restricted state. New positions blocked.
- **Total outage**: Trading paused. No liquidations. Positions preserved until data returns.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Multiple validation layers protect against bad data
- Mark Price smoothing adds another buffer
- Markets may pause if oracle quality is compromised
- All oracle handling is deterministic and transparent
- Brief irregularities typically don't affect your positions
