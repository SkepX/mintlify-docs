title: 'Probability Drift & Sudden Resolution'
description: 'Handling probability drift and unexpected resolutions'
---

Prediction markets evolve in two ways: gradual drift over time, or sudden resolution in an instant. Both create unique challenges for leveraged trading.

---

## Probability Drift

Probability drift is the slow, steady movement of probability as new information accumulates.

**Example:** A market on "Will Company X be acquired?" moves from 25% → 34% → 48% → 61% over three months as news develops. No single event caused a dramatic move.

**Risks during drift:**

- **Funding costs**: If you hold a crowded position for weeks, funding payments accumulate
- **Margin erosion**: Slow adverse drift can gradually bring you toward liquidation without triggering urgency

**Tip:** Monitor margin ratio daily during adverse drift. Add margin proactively.

## Sudden Resolution

Sudden resolution is when an outcome becomes known instantly: election results, Fed decisions, merger announcements.

The probability jumps from somewhere in the middle to 0% or 100% within seconds.

**What happens:**

1. Resolution source confirms the outcome
2. Index Price jumps to final value (0% or 100%)
3. Mark Price converges rapidly (clamping ensures it tracks)
4. All positions settle. PnL is finalized.

## PnL at Resolution

| Entry | Direction | Settles at 100% | Settles at 0% |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 40% | LONG | +60% | −40% |
| 40% | SHORT | −60% | +40% |
| 70% | LONG | +30% | −70% |
| 70% | SHORT | −30% | +70% |

At higher entry prices, LONGs have less upside but more downside. At lower entry prices, the opposite.

## Managing Resolution Risk

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Exit before resolution">
    You don't have to hold through the event. If price moved from 40% to 75%, consider taking profit rather than gambling on the final outcome.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reduce exposure">
    Lower your position size or leverage before known resolution events. Smaller position = smaller maximum loss.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Accept the bet">
    Some traders intentionally hold through resolution. If your thesis is strong and sizing is appropriate, this is valid.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Unexpected Resolution

Sometimes resolution happens earlier or differently than expected:

- Candidate drops out
- Deal announced ahead of schedule
- Contested or ambiguous results

Ascend handles this with predefined resolution criteria. No manual judgment is applied. If resolution cannot be determined, markets may be voided.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Drift is gradual; watch for funding costs and margin erosion
- Resolution is instant and binary
- You can exit before resolution to avoid binary risk
- Higher entry price = more downside risk for LONGs
- Unexpected resolution follows predefined rules
