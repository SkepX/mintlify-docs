title: 'Drift & Resolution'
description: 'How prices move gradually vs jump instantly at the end'
---

Prices move in two ways: slowly over time, or all at once when the event resolves. Both matter for how you manage positions.

---

## Slow Drift

Drift is when prices creep in one direction as news trickles in.

**Example:** A market on "Will Company X be acquired?" moves from 25% to 61% over three months. No single event caused a big jump. It just drifted.

**What to watch:**

- **Funding adds up**: Holding a crowded position for weeks means paying funding the whole time
- **Margin shrinks quietly**: A slow move against you can bring you close to liquidation before you notice

**Tip:** Check your margin daily if the price is drifting against you. Add margin early.

---

## Instant Resolution

Resolution is when the outcome becomes known and the price jumps to 0% or 100% in seconds.

**Examples:** Election results, Fed decisions, merger announcements.

**What happens:**

1. The outcome is confirmed
2. Price jumps to 0% or 100%
3. All positions settle instantly
4. Your PnL is locked in

---

## What You Make (or Lose) at Resolution

| Entry | Direction | If settles at 100% | If settles at 0% |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| 40% | LONG | +60% | -40% |
| 40% | SHORT | -60% | +40% |
| 70% | LONG | +30% | -70% |
| 70% | SHORT | -30% | +70% |

**The higher your entry, the more a LONG can lose.** At 70%, a LONG only gains 30% if right, but loses 70% if wrong.

## You Do Not Have to Hold Through Resolution

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Take profit early">
    If price moved from 40% to 75%, you can close and take the 35 point gain. You do not have to wait for the final outcome.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Reduce size">
    Lower your position or leverage before known events. Smaller position means smaller max loss.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hold through">
    Some traders want the full payout. If your thesis is strong and your size is right, holding through is fine.
  </Tab>

## When Resolution Surprises You

Sometimes things resolve earlier or differently than expected:

- A candidate drops out
- A deal gets announced ahead of schedule
- Results are contested

Ascend uses predefined rules for every market. No one decides manually. If the outcome cannot be determined, the market may be voided and positions returned.

---

## Summary

- Drift is slow. Watch funding costs and margin erosion.
- Resolution is instant. Price jumps to 0% or 100%.
- You can exit anytime before resolution.
- Higher entry = more downside for LONGs.
