description: "Why probabilities of outcomes are the core trading object."

A lot of action happens before a particular event outcome is even finalized. Narratives and opinions shift as new information emerges. With old trading models your only option for participation was indirect. Buy a stock, sell an option, wait for the outcome.

With Ascend, you now have the opportunity to trade on the probability of a particular outcome in real-time. Perpetually, with leverage.

## What is Ascend?

Ascend is an **events perpetuals platform** that enables **leveraged trading on probability prices**.

Markets on Ascend express exposure through **LONG / SHORT positions on probabilities**, while offering the **depth, flexibility, and tooling of a modern perpetuals exchange**.

## How Ascend Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Market">
    Select an **outcome market** expressed as a percentage, covering **outcomes, metals, commodities, stocks, or crypto**.

    Each market represents the current probability price.

    Trade the probability you think the market is mispricing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Long or Short the Probability %">
    Take a **LONG** position if you believe the probability will move higher, or a **SHORT** position if you believe it will move lower.

    Set your **position size and leverage** within the market's margin framework.

    Your exposure scales with leverage, while risk is governed by explicit market rules.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trade the Move">
    As the probability price moves in your favor, **PnL scales with your leveraged exposure**.

    Positions update continuously, and you can **close or adjust at any time**, settling according to deterministic market mechanics.
  </Step>
</Steps>
