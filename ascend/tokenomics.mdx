## ASCEND Utility

$ASCEND is the native utility token powering Ascend Markets, an events perpetuals platform.

It plays a central role in aligning traders, liquidity providers, and long term protocol participants.

---

## Key Utilities

### 1. Collateral Utility

ASCEND can be used as **additional collateral** across Ascend's prediction perpetuals and event-based markets.

Using ASCEND as collateral provides:

- **Discounted trading fees**
- **Access to higher effective leverage**
- **Priority participation in new markets and modes**

In the event of liquidation, any ASCEND used as collateral may be **burned**, creating a deflationary mechanism aligned with protocol risk.

---

### 2. Staking & Fee Sharing

ASCEND holders can stake their tokens to earn a **share of protocol-generated fees**, including:

- Trading fees
- Funding-related fees
- Future premium market fees

Staking aligns long-term token holders with the growth and success of the Ascend ecosystem.

---

### 3. Trading Fee Discounts

ASCEND holders receive **discounted trading fees** when using the platform.

Fee discounts:

- Apply to all prediction and event perpetual markets
- Can be **stacked** with discounts from using ASCEND as collateral
- Incentivize active usage and long-term holding

---

### 4. Governance

ASCEND is the **governance token** of Ascend Markets.

Token holders can vote on:

- Protocol upgrades
- New market launches
- Risk parameters (leverage caps, funding bounds, settlement rules)
- Treasury usage and ecosystem initiatives

Governance ensures Ascend evolves in line with its community and active traders.
